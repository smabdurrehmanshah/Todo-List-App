# Todo List Application
<P>I have created a to-do list application using JavaScript, with HTML and CSS for structure and styling. This project has been beneficial for understanding real-world applications and practicing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which has helped me grasp the core concepts of programming. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as done, edit, and delete them.</p>
